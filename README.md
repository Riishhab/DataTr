Subject: Request for Assistance with Graduate Role Transition

Dear team,

I hope you’re doing well. I am currently part of the Graduate Technology program at Barclays, based in Radbroke, and I am reaching out to explore the possibility of transitioning to the Sales, Trading, and Structuring (STS) Graduate Programme.

Over the course of my time here, I have developed a strong interest in the dynamics of global markets, particularly in the areas of sales, trading, and structuring. My passion for this field, coupled with the skill set I have been building in my current role, has driven me to pursue this opportunity to contribute directly to Barclays’ Markets division.

I would greatly appreciate your guidance and support in facilitating this transition. Could you kindly advise on the process for switching graduate schemes, or if there are any steps I need to follow to make this move? I am eager to align my career path with my interests in global markets and would be grateful for any assistance you can provide.

Thank you for your time and support, and I look forward to your advice on the next steps.


Kind regards,



Dear [HR's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in transitioning from the Technology Graduate program to the Sales, Trading, and Structuring (STS) Graduate Scheme at Barclays. My passion for Financial Technology and Global Markets, coupled with the skill set I have been building in my current role, has driven me to explore the opportunity to contribute directly to Barclays’ Markets division.

The STS Graduate Programme offers a unique opportunity to build the quantitative, analytical, and communication skills that are crucial for excelling in this field. The fast-paced nature of markets, along with the exposure to asset classes like Credit, Equities, and Structuring, aligns strongly with my interests and aspirations. I am particularly motivated by the idea of monitoring markets, generating trade ideas, and contributing to client strategies that help institutional investors navigate complex market conditions.

Over the past weeks, alongside my BAU activities, I have taken steps to engage with that business function and understand how I will be the right fit for that area. I have been completing the IB University courses on Learning Labs and actively participating in internal discussions and town halls within the CIB division. These experiences have further solidified my desire to contribute directly to the growth and success of our organization.

I am confident that the knowledge and technical foundation I have built in the Technology Graduate Scheme, combined with my passion for global markets, make me a strong candidate for this transition. I would be grateful for your guidance and support in facilitating this move and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my skills can be of value to the Sales, Trading, and Structuring team.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your feedback and am happy to provide any additional information.

Please find the letter attached to this email detailing how I have uniquely positioned myself to further my interests and why it is the right fit.


Kind regards,


Would it be a good idea to send a letter attachment along with my email to hr and the Internal Mobility team detailing why I am a good fit for a role in Sales? If so, write one accordingly. 

Over the past few weeks, I have completed 11 IB University courses on the Learning Labs portal and have engaged in town halls, podcasts, and communication within CIB. I am fond of the fast-paced environment and am highly adaptable to dynamic working patterns. With the permission of my people leader, I spent 67 hours working from the London office last week, voluntarily spending 35 hours on top of my BAU to explore the markets and sales division, which I am passionate about. I am networked with colleagues in that area for guidance and understanding of their responsibilities. 



Respected Enabler,

I am writing this letter to express interest in Global Markets & Sales. Over recent weeks, I have actively focused on gaining a deeper understanding of that division, and I am confident that my background, skills, and dedication have positioned me well to thrive in a front office role. 

Here are a few key points highlighting my preparedness for the transition:

Learning and Development: I have completed 11 Investment Banking University courses on the Learning Labs portal, focused on building my industry knowledge. These courses have helped me better understand the financial products, client strategies, and market dynamics that are crucial in the Sales and Trading roles.
Engagement with CIB: I actively participate in town halls, podcasts, and internal communications within the CIB business division to stay informed about the latest trends, challenges, and opportunities in the markets.
Exploring the Sales Division: With the permission of my people leader, I worked 67 hours from 1CP last week, including 35 hours voluntarily beyond my regular duties. I aimed to immerse myself in the Markets and Sales division, learning more about the day-to-day responsibilities, client interactions, and market strategies. During this time, I engaged with colleagues within the division to network and understand their roles and responsibilities better.
Adaptability and Passion for Fast-paced Environments: I thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments and am highly adaptable to changing circumstances. This quality, combined with my technical and analytical skills honed in Technology, makes me confident that I would bring value to the business.

I believe these experiences have provided me with a strong foundation and a clear understanding of the requirements and responsibilities within the Markets division. I would be grateful for your assistance in facilitating this transition and look forward to any feedback or further steps in the process.

Thank you for your time and consideration.


Yours sincerely,
