**Subject:** Re: Introduction and Shadowing Opportunity

Dear [Recipient's Name],

Thank you for reaching out! I hope you had a restful time during your annual leave.

I’m really excited about the opportunity to shadow you and look forward to learning more about your work in Business Banking pricing and 1LOD Risk. Unfortunately, I won’t be in Radbroke tomorrow, but a Teams call later in the week sounds great. Please feel free to let me know when it works best for you, and I will make sure to be available.

Thanks again for the opportunity, and I look forward to meeting you soon.

Best regards,
