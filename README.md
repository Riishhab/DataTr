- Data Collection & Model Training: Gather internal processes, product-specific workflows, regulatory requirements and client servicing steps for various banking offerings to train the GenAI model on product delivery steps (e.g: DCM: T-bills, syndicated loans)

- Integration: Embedding the GenAI tool within the existing RM platform (CRM or internal software)


Impact
RMs save valuable time by automating complex procedural steps. 

This ensures consistency, reduces errors, and accelerates product delivery, improving client satisfaction. 

It empowers RMs to focus on relationship-building rather than administrative tasks.
